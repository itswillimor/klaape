   - Add chat functionality

## Migration Notes

- The existing local storage-based user management has been replaced with a Django backend
- The UI components have been preserved but enhanced for better user experience
- The project structure now follows best practices for a full-stack application
- The backend is now ready for deployment to a production environment

## Database Migration

### From AsyncStorage to PostgreSQL

The original app used React Native's AsyncStorage for data persistence, which has several limitations:

1. Limited storage capacity
2. No relational data support
3. Data is only stored on the device
4. No server-side validation

The new architecture uses PostgreSQL, which provides:

1. Scalable storage for millions of users
2. Full relational database capabilities
3. Server-side data validation and processing
4. Secure authentication and authorization

### Using PostgreSQL in GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces provides a PostgreSQL service that can be used during development. To use it:

1. Set the `USE_POSTGRES` environment variable to `True`
2. Configure the database connection using the environment variables in `.env`
3. Run migrations with `python manage.py migrate`

Alternatively, you can use the provided Docker Compose file to run PostgreSQL locally:

```bash
docker-compose up -d db
```
