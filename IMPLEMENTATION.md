# Klaape Implementation Summary

## User Flow Implementation

We have successfully migrated the complete user flow from the existing Klaape app to the new architecture:

1. **Splash Screen**: Animated logo display that transitions to the Auth screen
2. **Auth Screen**: Login and signup functionality with animated transitions
3. **Email Verification**: 6-digit code verification with auto-advancing inputs
4. **Role Selection**: Choose between Regular User, Pro Creator, or Business
5. **Profile Setup**: Role-specific profile creation with animated UI elements
6. **Profile Picture**: Image selection with custom avatar frames

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend

- **React Native**: Used for cross-platform mobile development
- **Navigation**: React Navigation for screen transitions
- **UI Components**: Custom components like CustomShapedAvatar
- **Image Handling**: Expo ImagePicker for camera and gallery access
- **Animations**: React Native Animated API for smooth transitions

### Backend

- **Django**: Core web framework
- **Django REST Framework**: API development
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database (with SQLite fallback for development)
- **Authentication**: Token-based authentication
- **Media Handling**: File uploads with proper storage

### Database Migration

- Moved from AsyncStorage to PostgreSQL for scalability
- Implemented proper relational models for users, content, and marketplace
- Added support for both development (SQLite) and production (PostgreSQL) databases
- Created Docker Compose setup for local PostgreSQL development

## Key Features

1. **Role-Based UI**: Different UI elements and fields based on user role
2. **Custom Avatar System**: Profile pictures with customizable frames
3. **Form Validation**: Input validation with helpful error messages
4. **Animated Transitions**: Smooth animations between screens and states
5. **Responsive Design**: Works on various screen sizes

## Development Setup

A setup script (`setup-dev.sh`) has been created to help with:

- Setting up the Python virtual environment
- Installing dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Starting PostgreSQL with Docker (if available)

## Next Steps

1. **Authentication**: Implement JWT token authentication
2. **Content Creation**: Add screens for creating and sharing content
3. **Marketplace**: Implement booking and payment systems
4. **Real-time Features**: Add WebSockets for live sessions and notifications
5. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests
